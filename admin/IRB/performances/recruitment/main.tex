Hi,

My name's Ali Alkhatib. % link to homepage
I'm a PhD student at Stanford.
I'm studying professional online performers
(like YouTubers, Twitch streamers, etc\dots)
--- basically anyone who does it as a major source of income.

Specifically, I'm looking into
the relationships people have with their platforms
--- so for instance, what it's like for
YouTubers to make their living from the videos they put on YouTube,
talking to and working with YouTube's admins,
and dealing with controversial ``meta'' topics like
sudden changes to rules on the platform.

I'm emailing because I saw your
[\textbf{online streaming/broadcasting channel}]
and I thought your perspective would be interesting.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to chat with me about anything relating to
[\textbf{streaming|YouTubing|etc\dots}]. % make it clear this'll be anonymous if desired

% What I had in mind is a chat that would probably take about 30 minutes,
% possibly with a few follow up conversations.
% I was figuring to video chat via
% FaceTime or Google Hangout or something for the first
% ``long'' conversation, and email for later follow ups.

If you're open to chatting about online performances and stuff, feel free to
\href{mailto:ali.alkhatib@cs.stanford.edu}{email me}
(\texttt{ali\allowbreak .alkhatib\allowbreak @cs\allowbreak .stanford.edu}) or
call me at my cell phone: ${+1~(408)~348-2720}$

PS: if you're curious what sort of research I generally do,
feel free to poke around at \href{https://ali-alkhatib.com}{my personal site}
(\texttt{https://\allowbreak ali-\allowbreak alkhatib\allowbreak .com}).
