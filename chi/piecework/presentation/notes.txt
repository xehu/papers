Big themes
[ ] In the three themes, cover fewer points and more examples. I think they're the most engaging. Have all of them, then animate some lighter opacity and dive into just one of them
[x] Less editorializing and more reflection in the body of the talk. Contain the editorializing to the end of the talk in a clearly circumscribed area
[ ] Not enough text on the slides in general. Slide 23 as an example: "History suggests both extremes." Which extremes? What does this mean? in general, needs more of the important ideas appearing on the slide. another example is the entire timeline
[x] 6: I want to understand WHY you're giving me a timeline. What should I be learning from this? What is the overall arc? (e.g., piecework started on farms, grew into factories, then died)
[x] 6: this doesn't feel like a timeline, it feels like a set of examples, but I don't know how they connect

High level
[x] 3: question 2 is too broad
[x] Needs an outline before Piecework Primer
[x] 11: as an example of compressing around fewer ideas — can we more directly explain the limit in piecework that GMaps is breaking down? I didn't get it
[x] 12: not sure what this implication means
[x] 16: make the the comparison to the previous slide more obvious. maybe a left half goals —> right half examples
[x] I think you shouldn't make claims about this being awesome "this is the gold mine in this thread of research" — instead be more reflective about the overall phenomenon
[x] weave in citations throughout

Low level
[x] 2: instead of naming systems, cite things e.g., [Alkhatib et al 2017]
[x] Put citations in a lighter font weight
[x] 5: header isn't aligned with text ("Piecework" and "Payment" in template)
[x] 6: cite authors for each of these case studies
[x] 7: color change is too subtle
[x] I love the "agrarian surge pricing" idea
[x] 9: add citations
[ ] 10: "DAMMIT, EARNSHAW!" ?
[x] 22: "Honestly…" too glib
[x] 22: too much editorializing
[x] 24: a slide "conclusion" should be the last slide, don't follow up with another thing
