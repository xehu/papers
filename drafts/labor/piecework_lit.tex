\section{A Review of Piecework}

\topic{The HCI community has used the term ``piecework'' to describe
myriad instantiations of on--demand labor,
but this reference has generally been offered in passing.}
As this paper principally traces a relationship between
the historical piecework and the contemporary crowd work
(or on--demand labor more generally),
this casual familiarity with piecework may prove insufficient.
We'll more carefully discuss piecework in this section in order
to inform the the rest of the argument.
Specifically, we will
\begin{inlinelist}
  \item define ``piecework'' as researchers in the topic understood it;
  \item trace the rise of piecework at a very high level,
        identifying key figures and ideas during this time; and finally
  \item look at the fall of piecework, such as it was,
        considering in particular
        the factors that may have led to piecework's
        eventual demise in the American and European labor markets.
        % \msb{did it demise? there are sweatshops around the world today}.
        % \ali{is it okay to corner it off like this (by just being about the US/EU)?}
\end{inlinelist}

% While piecework has been studied from myriad perspectives through the lenses of
% political science,
% economics (both micro-- and macro--), and
% a plethora of other fields
% \ali{should I cite examples of all of these?}, for the sake of brevity
% we will discuss the history of piecework in the contexts of the three questions we brought up with crowd work:
% ``\namerefl{sec:complexity}'',
% ``\namerefl{sec:decomposition}'', and 
% ``\namerefl{sec:relationships}''.


\subsection{What was piecework?}
\topic{Aligning on--demand work with piecework requires an understanding of what piecework is.}
While ``piecework'' has had multiple definitions over time,
we can trace a constellation of characteristics that recur throughout the literature.
We will follow this history of research, collecting
descriptions,
examples, and
provided definitions of piecework, trying
to trace the outline of a working understanding of
\textit{what piecework is}.

\citeauthor{hughRaynbirdTaskWork} offers
a concise definition of piecework
--- which he variously also calls ``measure work'', ``grate work'', and ``task work'' ---
by contrasting the ``task--labourer'' with the ``day--labourer'':
``\dots the chief difference lies between the day--labourer,
who receives a certain some of money\dots~for his day's work,
and the task--labourer, whose earnings depend on the \textit{quantity} of work done [emphasis added]''
\cite{hughRaynbirdTaskWork}.
\citeauthor{10.2307/2338394} gives a more illustrative definition of piecework,
offering examples:
``\dots~payment is made for each hectare which is pronounced to be well ploughed~\dots~
for each living foal got from a mare;~\dots~
for each living calf got~\dots'' etc\dots
\cite{10.2307/2338394}.
This framing perhaps makes the most intuitive sense;
``payment for results'', as \citeauthor{10.2307/2338394} calls it,
is not only common in practice, but well--studied in labor economics as well
\cite{Figlio2007901,weitzman1976new,10.2307/3003414,BJIR:BJIR038}.

\topic{It's worth acknowledging that
``this distinction [between piece--rates and time--rates] was not completely clear--cut''
\cite{hart2013rise}.}
Indeed, we see work that adopts
piece--rate compensation in some aspects and
time--rate compensation in others.
The ``Rowan premium system'',
which essentially paid workers
a base rate for time plus
(the potential for) an additional pay dependent on output,
was just one of several alternatives to stricter time-- and piece--rate renumeration paradigms, which
muddies the waters for us later as we attempt to categorize cases of piecework
\cite{rowan1901premium}.
As \citeauthor{rowan1901premium}'s premium system guaranteed an hourly rate
regardless of the worker's productive output
\textit{as well as} an additional compensation tied to performance,
workers under this regime were in some senses ``task--labourers'',
and in other senses
(more conventional)
``day--labourers''.
% \ali{I want to come back to this later when we talk about Uber \& Lyft, and
%      how they increasingly offer to guarantee drivers an hourly rate
%      \cite[see][]{uberHourly,lyftHourly}.
%      That's why I'm nitpicking about this muddied system --- to avoid someone saying
%      ``it doesn't seem like piecework to me anymore if there's an hourly wage floor''}

\topic{It may be worth thinking about piecework through the lens of its \textit{emergent} properties to help understand it.}
Returning to
\citeauthor{hughRaynbirdTaskWork}, several arguments for the merits of piecework
% \msb{inconsistent use of ``piece work'' vs. ``piecework'' in the non-quoted text. Which do you want?}
% \ali{Okay here's the problem: I'm happy to use ``piecework'' and that's the word that exists in the dictionary, but
% at the time that \citeauthor{hughRaynbirdTaskWork} was writing, it was ``piece work'' and I don't know if
% this is a trivial enough thing that I can just quietly concatenate his/their quotations so it looks like they say ``piecework''.
% I think at this point I was just calling it ``piece work'' because at this point in history people were calling it that.
% I've just changed everything out of quotation marks to ``piecework[er[s]]'', and
% left everything in quotation marks as ``piece work''.}
crop up; he points out that\dots
``piece work holds out to the labourer an increase of wages as a reward for his skill and exertion\dots
he knows that all depends on his own diligence and perseverance\dots~[and]
so long as he performs his work to the satisfaction of his master,
he is not under that control to which the day--labourer is always subject.''
\citeauthor{hughRaynbirdTaskWork} (and others, as we will see)
highlight the freedom from control that ``task--labourers'' enjoy
\cite{hughRaynbirdTaskWork,rowan1901premium}.

\topic{We see this sense of independence regardless of the time, locale, and industry.}
\citeauthor{10.2307/3827491} offers a look into the lives and culture of ``match girls''
--- young women paid by piecework to assemble matchsticks generally in the late \nth{19} century.
Of particular interest was their independent nature, via their reputation ``\dots~for generosity, independence, and protectiveness,
but also for brashness, irregularity, low morality, and little education''
\cite{10.2307/3827491}.
\citeauthor{10.2307/27508091} documents piecework from 1850--1930 in Australia,
finding similar assertions of the freedom compositors of newspapers experienced as pieceworkers:
``If a piece--work compositor who held a `frame' decided that he did not want to work on a particular day or night,
the management recognised his right to put a `substitute' or `grass' compositor in his place''
\cite{10.2307/27508091}.
From these accounts we should be able to identify
a sense of independence that
resonates across decades, industries, and locales where piecework is found.
We'll problematize this supposed advantage as we trace the history of piecework,
but for now we can say that piecework affords
independence and some sense of autonomy
new to people in the working class.


\topic{\citeauthor{hart2013rise} offer another series of compelling insights toward the question of the features that sprout from piecework.}
In their reflection on the features endemic to piecework in the 1930s,
which they describe as the ``heyday'' of piecework's prominence;
among them were the following:
\begin{inlinelist}
\item ``female workers who generally had less training'' had to be trained in narrower subsets of the general body of skills that conventional (male) apprentices would undertake, and
\item workers with specific slices of skills could be more appropriately matched to suitable tasks
\end{inlinelist}
\cite{hart2013rise}.
Piecework thus opened the door for people who previously couldn't participate in the labor market
--- either for lack of training or for other reasons ---
to do so, and to acquire job skills incrementally.
Workers without conventional training
--- like women, who had no such opportunities to engage in engineering and metalworking apprenticeships as men did ---
could be trained very narrowly on a very tightly constrained task,
demonstrate proficiency, and become experts in their own ways.

In summary, piecework:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item paid workers for quantity of work done, rather than time done, but occasionally mixed the two payment models;
  \item afforded workers freedom in when and how much to work; and
  \item structured tasks such that people who didn't have the training to engage in the traditional labor force could still participate.
\end{enumerate}
\ali{woah i thought this was a comment; is it okay as is?}



\ali{REMOVED A BUNCH OF STUFF FROM HERE ONWARD}


\subsection{The Historical Arc of Piecework}\label{sec:pieceworkArc}
\topic{Piecework's history traces back further perhaps than most would expect.}
\citeauthor{grier2013computers} describes the process astronomers adopted of hiring young boys
to calculate equations in order
to better--predict the trajectories of various celestial bodies in the \nth{19} century
\cite{grier2013computers}.
While this approach didn't become the same economic powerhouse as later examples would,
Airy \msb{This is the first time Airy comes up. Who are they?} and others arguably found the kernel of insight that we pursue throughout this discussion:
determining the extent to which work can be decomposed, and
finding the limits of complexity of that decomposed work.
That is, Airy found that he could train youths in elementary mathematics
to complete the majority of the calculations he would otherwise have had to solve on his own,
and that the greater body of work could ultimately be completed sooner
if he arranged his work appropriately.
\msb{After reading this paragraph, I don't know what it's supposed to be teaching me.
What I got out of it is that a bunch of people did piecework, but
I don't know why or in fact why these are different than the sources we cite earlier.
Can you hone it?}
\ali{I wanted that paragraph to be about the rising popularity and application of piecework
(especially as it approached its ``heyday'' \cite{hart2013rise}),
coming from humble beginnings as it found its footing.
Given that intent\dots\\
Should I \textbf{refactor} or \textbf{rewrite}?}

\ali{\sout{I'm thinking of dropping most of the last paragraph and merging it with the next one. Thoughts?}
I moved it to \nameref{sec:complexity}}




\ali{??? Why is this here? Can it be moved?}
\topic{As increasing attention revealed problems in piecework as it related to workers,
workers themselves began to speak out about their frustration with this new regime.}
It began, arguably, with \citeauthor{riisOtherSideLives}'s photo--documentary work,
but this led to industry organizations representing
railway workers, mechanical engineers, and others contributing their myriad perspectives
\cite{american1921problem,richards1904anything,riisOtherSideLives}.
Nevertheless, piecework continued to permeate low--skilled labor.
% \ali{How does this tie in with the rest of the narrative? Can I move this around? Does it break everything to take it out of chronological order?}




\ali{???}
\topic{Piecework's popularity in the United States and Europe plummeted almost as quickly as it had climbed.}
\citeauthor{hart2013rise}'s work substantively explores the precipitous decline of piecework in the last third of the \nth{20} century.
In their work, \citeauthor{hart2013rise} offer a number of explanations for the sudden vanishing of piecework.
The salient suggestions include:
\begin{inlinelist}
\item the emergence of more effective, more nuanced incentive models
--- rewarding teams for complex achievements, for instance;
\item the shifting of these industries (manufacturing, clothing, etc\dots)
to other countries;
\item the quality of ``multidimensional'' work becoming too difficult to evaluate.
\end{inlinelist}
\cite{hart2013rise}.



\subsection{Why is piecework relevant to crowd work?}

\msb{I assume this is forthcoming?}
Using the definition of piecework that we came up with earlier, we argue that
crowd work is fundamentally an instantiation of piecework, and
that we can more precisely anticipate the answers to the open research questions we discussed earlier.
We'll show that the dimensions of crowd work that the broader HCI community has been studying
align with the history of piecework, and that this can greatly inform predictions about the future of crowd work.
\subsection{From piecework to on--demand work}
Crowd work and gig work are fundamentally an instantion of piecework.
First, workers on platforms such as Mechanical Turk and Uber are generally incentivized by unit of work, even if some may be offered an hourly base salary as well.
Second, workers are attracted to these platforms by the freedom they offer to pick the time and place of work~\cite{martin2014being,whyWouldAnyoneBrewer}.
Third, system developers as on Mechanical Turk typically assume no professional skills in transcription or other areas, and attempt to build that expertise into the workflow~\cite{noronha2011platemate,bernsteinSoylent}.

Given this alignment, many of the same properties of piecework historically will apply to on--demand work as well. In the next section, we perform this application to three of the major questions in crowd work and gig work, identifying similarities and differences between historical piecework and modern on--demand work.
