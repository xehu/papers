  % \section{The Bleak Future of Crowd Work}
  % We've traced a path from piecework itself through
  % the processes that describe the design and implementation of piece work and crowd work as part of the same thread;
  % in tracing this process, we touched on the relationships between decomposition,
  % work \& worker abstraction,
  % flexibility, and followed through both the general fallout of crowd work in the research community
  % as well as the fallout between workers and the managers and other external parties
  % --- including researchers.

  % Throughout these case studies, we have pointed out the parallels between
  % the contemporary research in on--demand labor and
  % the much larger body of research constituting our understanding of topics such as
  % piecework, factory work, and laborer relations.
  % If we agree that this framing is useful and informative, then
  % several topics emerge as relatively open questions in the study of crowd work and on--demand labor.
  % Two of the most pressing questions are
  % \begin{inlinelist}
  % \item the beginnings of factories, and 
  % \item the decline of relevance of worker advocacy organizations.
  % \end{inlinelist}
  % We will discuss those questions here.



  % \subsection{The beginnings of factories}\label{sec:Factorization}
  % We established earlier that abstracted work and low wages tend to result in variable outcomes,
  % which presents problems for employers.
  % % So work output is variable, and that's bad. What are we doing about it?
  % Historically, this is what led to factories; by employing a cohort of known workers,
  % we can be reasonably assured that the quality of the work will be better than random.
  % Furthermore, we can invest more resources in training workers and
  % get workers to do more complex work with more context.
  % % you would pay some experts who understood what they needed to do
  % % and they would form a cohort into which you invest more.

  

  % This, then, suggests that the beginning of the regularization of workforces
  % --- a sort of coalescence of factories ---
  % is already happening.
  % If our framing of on--demand labor is accurately describing an underlying relationship with piecework,
  % then we should watch for the emergence and popularization of persistent teams of workers.
  % While this field site will likely prove exceedingly difficult to 
  % Social computing researchers should seek to understand this process more
  % fully, as we a

  % \subsection{The decline of advocacy organizations}
  

  % \section{Implications for Design}
  % If it's agreed that
  % the major topics we've discussed thus far are related and
  % --- at least to \textit{some} extent ---
  % precipitated in the fashion we argue,
  % then we have a rare opportunity as researchers,
  % and as agents of change in the communities we study,
  % to affect change on the dynamics of crowd and on--demand work
  % as they continue to develop.

  % Without claiming to have easy, cut--and--dry solutions to these problems,
  % we can nevertheless bring to attention a number of critical opportunities to
  % learn from historical parallels in piecework and factory labor,
  % and make informed decisions regarding whether
  % (or indeed how)
  % we may want to influence outcomes.
  % The challenges we bring to attention here are as follows:
  % \begin{inlinelist}
  %   \item codifying investment toward collective goods into the designs of systems;
  %   \item (re--)decentralizing the internet; and
  %   \item enabling reputation transferral.
  % \end{inlinelist}


  % \subsection{Codify the common good}
  % As \citeauthor{lessig2006code} points out in his book,
  % digital media give designers the opportunity to design and build into the systems
  % policies and practices to contribute to the collective benefit of the people therein
  % \cite{lessig2006code}.
  % Historically, the confluence of forces \citeauthor{lessig2006code} describes
  % would ultimately result in outcomes such as benefits for workers,
  % funds for sick leave and vacation, and other conveniences.
  % The transient nature of on--demand work would seem to problematize this arrangement,
  % but we can discuss and explore the viability of building into systems the mechanisms necessary
  % to save a portion of payment from every gig,
  % record taxable income, or
  % myriad other generally administrative tasks automatically.


  % \subsection{Decentralize the internet --- again}
  % Digitally mediated on--demand labor markets have historically been insular and incompatible with one another,
  % forcing workers either to choose one or juggle participation in these markets with great difficulty.
  % An ``API'' for on--demand labor markets could make it possible for any person
  % or organization to instantiate their own marketplace and inter--operate with.
  % This can be changed, and indeed must, if we are to realize the hopes of early researchers who advocated the
  % democratizing nature and power of the internet
  % \cite{barlow2009declaration,lanier2014owns}.

  % \subsection{Deal with reputation}
  % Reputation systems in on--demand labor markets are fundamentally broken.
  % To say nothing of the fact that information workers (such as those on AMT) can't transfer their reputations to qualitatively different forms of labor
  % like driving--for--hire (e.g. Uber), even within the same industry
  % it's currently not feasible for workers to transfer their reputations or other information from one place to another.
  % This affects more than the reputation and trustworthiness of workers;
  % accounting for things such as taxes, benefits, etc\dots is all but left to the individual workers, who struggle with myriad bureaucratic obstacles.
  % We can design systems that facilitate the aggregation and, more importantly, the transferral of reputation, income, and other features of work.



  % \section{Discussion}
  % We've discussed a number of aspects of on--demand work that
  % offer parallels with historical piecework.
  % Perhaps more importantly, we've hopefully demonstrated that the dynamics we observe in on--demand work
  % are interrelated and follow from one another just as necessarily as they did in
  % the development and maturation of piecework and factory work through the \nth{20} century.
  % This framing on on--demand work should, we hope, provide us with the necessary historical context
  % to make better--informed design decisions about how we want ``the future of crowd work'' to look.

  % \section{Conclusion}
  % \citeauthor{crowdworkFuture} discussed many of the challenges and problems in crowd work in \citeyear{crowdworkFuture},
  % but didn't necessarily situate the notion of crowd work in a broader context.
  % This paper attempts to fill that gap, and in doing so hopes
  % to give the research community theoretical grounding to work with and within on--demand labor more successfully.
  % But more than that, we hope to have addressed important questions to inform how we actually might make crowd work
  % a career in which we want our children to work.
