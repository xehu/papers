\begin{abstract}
  With growing attention toward on--demand labor
  --- ranging from the ``sharing economy'' to information work ---
  scholars have made connections to various frameworks 
  and mechanisms such as worker advocacy, empowerment, and Taylorism,
  to make sense of our observations of
  on--demand work and the workers that power this movement.
  We argue that the literature surrounding ``piecework''
  informs and even predicts both the contributions
  that have been made toward the development of on--demand labor and crowd work
  as well as the fallout among workers and researchers
  with regard to the disillusionment and alienation of work.
  
  After evaluating this framing
  through a series of case studies,
  we look to the future
  to identify worthwhile questions and
  points of inquiry, such as the movement toward factories,
  that researchers in social computing should consider
  as we attempt to anticipate and perhaps shape the future of work.

\section{Case Studies}
The existing body of research has shed light on on--demand labor from various perspectives,
and revealed a number of topics that,
through our framing, are clearly situated together.
Those topics are, at a high level, as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the \textbf{processes} involved in making work into tasks, or discretization;
\item the outcomes (and indeed the \textbf{fallout}) of that discretization,
both on the work itself as well as the workers;
and finally
\item the \textbf{relationships} between workers and requesters of the work
--- both \textit{cooperative} and \textit{adversarial} cases.
\end{enumerate}

% We will follow these topics, using them as prompts for case studies in
% the emergence and
% development of contemporary piecework.

\subsection{The Processes of Making Gig(s) Work}\label{sec:MakingGigsWork}
% this is phase 1: the decomposition & abstraction of work;
% all of the research that has gone into work--flows and
% all the things we can do with crowd work.

\cite{olson2014ways}
The HCI community is perhaps most familiar with examples of task--based work such as
99designs,
Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT),
and increasingly
Uber \& Lyft,
which all allow requesters in various forms to tap into
resources such as
cars,
computers, and above all
``cognitive surplus''
with relative ease
\cite{howe2006rise,DillahuntPromise,storiesIraniSilberman,shirky2010cognitive}.
This insight, that
workers can be geographically distributed and tasks decomposed,
% (especially given careful central management of those workers, discussed later),
has proven remarkably compelling
and an effective fulcrum for leveraging the Internet for highly scalable work
\cite{sensitiveTasks,embracingErrorKrishna}.


This section will largely discuss the processes at work that make distributed,
digitally managed work both possible and indeed preferable for ``requesters''
(in other words, the employers who solicit workers).
This body of research spans a broad field
within the CSCW and broader HCI community.
In this context,
we'll look at the body of research through the lens of
highlighting contributions which expand what we
(as ``requesters'' of work) can do by managing workers in novel ways.
This work broadly consists of three areas:
\begin{inlinelist}
\item \nameref{sec:decomposition},
\item \nameref{sec:workAbstraction}, and
\item \nameref{sec:flexibility}
\end{inlinelist}.
As we explore this work, we'll
attempt to relate the advances in the design of crowd work to
the research contributions made in the research of assembly line manufacturing,
Taylorism, and
scientific management 
during the \nth{20} century
\cite{hu1961parallel}.


\subsubsection{Decomposition}\label{sec:decomposition}
Piecework may be thought of as vertically slicing work such that 
each person is responsible for the whole task
--- making a whole garment, in this case.
Broken down in this way, work could grow to unprecedented scales,
but the quality of the work would remain relatively variable
\cite{murray1983decentralisation}.
Textile work being a salient example,
it took time for workers to acquire sufficient skill
to do every aspect of the work so that the garment would be accepted by the company soliciting that work
\cite{vezina1992light}.

A compelling solution emerged in the early \nth{20} century to break tasks down into discrete,
manageable routines that could be taught relatively easily,
and whose work output could be evaluated in abstraction from the rest of the work
\cite{restructuringPieceworkBaker}.
In Ford's assembly line, this meant that workers were not responsible for building a whole car,
but a single very narrowly defined action that needed to be done on every car
\cite{towardsGlobalFordism}.
By the mid--\nth{20} century, \citeauthor{schoenberger1988fordism} writes,
``\dots~the intensification of the labor process is argued to have hit mental, physical, and social limits.''
\cite{schoenberger1988fordism}.


This approach, ``Fordism'' (and its better--known contemporary ``Taylorism'' of similar ethos),
can be seen today in crowd work and on--demand labor through the application of micro--tasks.
\citeauthor{writingMicroTasks} highlight some of the advantages of breaking work into pieces,
facilitating evaluation and parallelization
\cite{writingMicroTasks}.
By decomposing and recomposing tasks,
and in particular by assigning similarly natured work to the same workers,
workers could become ``experts'' in a small aspect of the work that they did,
speeding their work dramatically
\cite{delayAndOrderLasecki}.
Perhaps more important, however, was that
the breaking down of work into tasks has made it more practical to evaluate work at each stage
\cite{rogstadius2011assessment}.

Scholarship describing and exploring
the decomposition of tasks is perhaps the most established of the above areas among HCI researchers;
\citeauthor{crowdForgeKittur} specifically drive at this goal by addressing the possibility of
``crowdsourcing complex work''
\cite{crowdForgeKittur}.
\citeauthor{cheng2015break} found that microtasks
--- though not necessarily \textit{faster} than ``macrotasks'' ---
yield higher quality work,
particularly when that work might be readily interrupted
\cite{cheng2015break}.
\citeauthor{selfsourcingTeevan2014} further push the boundaries of decomposed work
by exploring ``selfsourcing'', and further this work with \citeauthor{selfsourcingTeevan2016}
\cite{selfsourcingTeevan2014,selfsourcingTeevan2016}.
While this work doesn't strictly fall under ``crowdsourcing'',
the major contributions here
seem uncontroversially to be inspired by the design of crowd work.

Much of the research in the space of designing crowd work has
sought to illustrate the potential to take highly creative or skilled work
and generate high--quality results.
Perhaps the most notable case study here can be found in
\citeauthor{foundry}'s \textit{Foundry}, which employed
``flash teams'' to achieve expert--level outcomes via thoughtful
decomposition of work as ``modular tasks''
\cite{foundry}.

Work decomposition, then, is far from new;
``decomposition'' generally illustrates the same concepts of work that ``Taylorism''
and scientific management sought to embody
---
\citeauthor{silberman2010ethics} in particular foresaw this danger and warned of it in
\citeyear{silberman2010ethics}
\cite{crowdworkFuture,silberman2010ethics,nickerson2013crowd}.
In both the historical and contemporary cases of decomposed work,
work was,
at least initially,
distributed in the form of tasks to the homes of workers;
\citeauthor{riisOtherSideLives} captured this in his documentary work
\citetitle{riisOtherSideLives}
in \citeyear{riisOtherSideLives}
\cite{riisOtherSideLives}.

\subsubsection{Work Abstraction}\label{sec:workAbstraction}
Decomposition allows requesters to assign tasks without concern for the broader context.
While we'll discuss this aspect of crowd work more critically later,
it's worth pointing out that discrete blocks of work containing all the relevant context for a worker
allows workers to engage with virtually any component of work without worrying that their lack of 
higher--level awareness of the goals of the requester might negatively affect their work.

\citeauthor{chilton2013cascade} perhaps best illustrated this with
\textit{Cascade} by demonstrating that it's possible to
break certain classes of tasks apart
in such a way that they yield taxonomies of various subjects,
a task previously thought to be safely within the domain of expert workers
with top--down awareness of the context of the work as a whole
\cite{chilton2013cascade}.
\citeauthor{verroios2014context} further illustrate this potential by
forming a task one might consider highly contextually dependent
--- summarizing the contents of a movie ---
in such a way that crowd workers could contribute small pieces of work without
needing to know the content of the rest of the project
\cite{verroios2014context}.

Here, \citeauthor{hu1961parallel}'s work,
saying of assembly line work that
``it is assumed that men are of equal ability and every man can do any of the $n$ jobs'',
parallels the approach that dominated early research into crowd work
--- namely, using non--expert crowds for complex work
\cite{hu1961parallel}.
This mindset in \citeauthor{hu1961parallel}'s analysis,
and indeed the study of factory and mass manufacturing labor through the \nth{20} century,
substantively owes its existence to scientific management
and the rigorous decomposition of work into tasks, discussed earlier,
and persists to this day as it colors
researchers' goals and objectives in the study and design of crowd work.

Piecework's influence on the abstraction of work into tasks,
described above, is more than just caused by the decomposition of work;
work abstraction itself makes it possible for workers to come and go flexibly,
prompting work requesters to consider ways to design these now discrete tasks in ways that
maximize flexibility, both by allowing (and even anticipating) some inconsistency in worker availability
\textit{and} allowing and anticipating some inconsistency in the quality of the work output itself.
It's to this area that we now turn our attention.

\subsubsection{Flexibility}\label{sec:flexibility}
% \msb{nothing in this subsubsection connects to the piecework literature. bring it back!}

Earlier we discussed \citeauthor{cheng2015break}'s work
measuring the impact that interruption has on worker performance.
This work both points to and embodies a broader sentiment in
both the study and practice
of crowd work that microtasks should be designed resiliently against the variability of workers,
% \msb{not sure what flexibly means here, and the rest of the sentence isn't helping me unpack it. flexibility for requester? worker? flexible algorthms?},
fully exploiting the abstracted nature of each piece of work
\cite{interruptionIqbal,delayAndOrderLasecki,vaish2014low}.
That is to say, micro--tasks should be designed such that a single worker's poor performance,
or a good worker's sudden departure,
would not significantly impact the agenda of the work as a whole.
While \citeauthor{cheng2015break} identified costs with breaking tasks into smaller components
in the form of higher cumulative time to complete
(albeit much shorter real time to complete, owing to parallelization),
\citeauthor{delayAndOrderLasecki} found that at least \textit{some} performance can be recouped by stringing 
similar tasks together.


Given the importance of consistent work results, one might intuit that
requesters would prefer high--quality workers who can be relied upon to be available
(even for contextually independent tasks),
which would appear to contradict the benefits of flexibility already discussed;
requesters have thus made significant headway toward
``embracing error'' to allow requesters to maximize the benefits of a flexible,
even transient,
workforce.

\citeauthor{embracingErrorKrishna} offer orders--of--magnitude improvements
in various binary classification tasks
on the principle that diverse workers complete these tasks
in order to accurately inform the model on the variety of delays in response times.
And rather than building tasks to \textit{tolerate} worker drop--off and attrition,
some researchers have designed work predicated on the expectation of this phenomenon:
\citeauthor{sensitiveTasks} describe ways of assigning tasks in such a way that
crowd workers would never be given enough information to piece together sensitive information about
any single topic
\cite{sensitiveTasks}.

Flexibility has been explored through the lens of Fordism, perhaps best illustrated by
\citeauthor{tolliday1986between}'s treatment describing
turnover rates rising above 300\% in the decade leading to the introduction of the assembly line in 1913.
Specifically, the utilization of ``\dots~`semi--special' machine tools which could be adapted
[and]~\dots~added flexibility through seasonal layoffs for production workers and the use of
piece rates~\dots~rather than a day wage system''
\cite{tolliday1986between}.



% \msb{I still dont' have a clear conceptual picture of what flexibility is, and what about it sets this section apart. Ranjay's stuff is about speed...? I'm confused.}




\subsection{The Fallout of Crowd Work}\label{sec:Fallout}
% If the research exploring and documenting how we can exploit crowd \textit{work} can be described as wide--ranging,
% the scholarship discussing the ways crowd \textit{workers} have been exploited is more focused;
\citeauthor{turkopticon} point out the disillusion that companies such as Amazon foster on platforms for work like AMT
(see also \citeauthor{dynamo}'s work
continuing in the spirit of this observation to generate collective action to improve worker conditions)
\cite{turkopticon,dynamo}.
\citeauthor{uberAlgorithm}
find similarly that workers on gig work platforms are frustrated by the systems on which they work,
to say little of the policies which these systems enforce
\cite{uberAlgorithm}.

We discussed the benefits of flexibility
(both in the sense of having arbitrary workers perform tasks and
in the sense that we can design tasks to be more resilient to poor work)
in the previous section.
It's from that point in the literature that we turn our attention to
the perhaps unintended effects of crowd work
and the affordances for transience that we build into this mode of work.
We'll address two major areas of work under this subject:
\begin{inlinelist}
\item \nameref{sec:lowPay}; and
\item \nameref{sec:varQualWork}.
\end{inlinelist}

\subsubsection{Low Pay}\label{sec:lowPay}


\citeauthor{laborEconomicsOfCrowdsourcingHorton}
identified problems with crowd work wages relatively early on,
attempting to address this imbalance from a behavioral economic perspective ---
that is, identifying and presenting a model that describes a worker's
``\textit{reservation wage}''
\cite{laborEconomicsOfCrowdsourcingHorton}.
This work has largely informed much of the research into and practice of estimating crowd work compensation
\cite{incentivesShaw,paolacci2010running}.

But we turn to \citeauthor{turkopticon}'s discussion of ``\textit{Turkopticon}'',
a system they designed to interrogate worker invisibility and to promote better wages across several dimensions
\cite{turkopticon}.
Of particular relevance here,
\citeauthor{turkopticon} call to attention that ``Turkers'' are ultimately vulnerable to
wage theft and
pay rates that translate to well under minimum wage.
Returning to \citeauthor{laborEconomicsOfCrowdsourcingHorton},
we find that the median ``reservation wage'' in \citeyear{laborEconomicsOfCrowdsourcingHorton}
was \$1.38, while the mean was \$3.63
\cite{laborEconomicsOfCrowdsourcingHorton}.

Understanding workers' motivations given these conditions has thus become a goal for some researchers
\cite{whyWouldAnyoneBrewer}.
\citeauthor{Sun20111033} conclude that
``\dots~solvers participate in online tasks
not only for money
but also for enjoyment
or the sense of self--worth''
\cite{Sun20111033}.
This might have rung true in \citeyear{Sun20111033},
and certainly corroborates \citeauthor{Ross}'s findings after investigating
``who are the crowdworkers'',
but as \citeauthor{whoareNOTtheTurkers} points out
``we [have since] learned that most tasks on AMT are done by a small group of professional Turkers\dots''
\cite{Ross,whoareNOTtheTurkers}.

Now, \citeauthor{turkopticon}
and later
\citeauthor{dynamo} cite insufficient pay as a central point of frustration among workers,
via \citeauthor{irani2015cultural} and \citeauthor{dawnDigitalSweatshopCushing}'s contributions in this space
\cite{dynamo,irani2015cultural,dawnDigitalSweatshopCushing,turkopticon}.

On--demand workers were not the first to be exploited along the dimension of low pay rates.
Frustration over low (and declining) pay was one of the chief grievances among then nascent
British labor unions in the early \nth{20} century
\cite{turner1952trade}.
This, \citeauthor{ebbinghaus1999institutions} argued,
fueled the rocketing union membership rates through the mid--\nth{20} century until 1980
(to which we'll return when we discuss \citeauthor{levi2009union}'s reexamination of labor unions)
\cite{ebbinghaus1999institutions,levi2009union}.
This realization has similarly fueled a body of research into
the various incentive structures available to piecework employers
\cite{roy1953work}.


The parallels between the complaints of low pay among crowd workers and other on--demand workers
and the pieceworkers and later factory workers in the \nth{20} century
are inescapable.
We argue further that the \textit{causes} here
--- work decomposition,
work abstraction, and
flexibility ---
lead inexorably to low and declining pay for workers.
Moreover, we point out that low pay leads to other negative outcomes both
in on--demand work
as well as
in piecework and on assembly lines.

\subsubsection{Variable quality work}\label{sec:varQualWork}
Researchers have struggled with what we might generously call work of ``variable quality''
along two dimensions.
The first, to use the characterization of one of these contributions, we can call
``understanding malicious behavior''
\cite{MaliciousCrowdworkersGadiraju}.
While some work has cast workers as ``malicious'' or at least adversarial parties,
the evidence thus far suggests that
workers behave in unexpected ways as they attempt to assert some control over their interaction with the system
(a topic of discussion to which we'll return later)
\cite{uberAlgorithm}.
The second dimension of research in this space generally attempts
to eke out the highest quality work possible from workers
given the apparent difficulty in predicting work outcomes
\cite{embracingErrorKrishna}.




% Low pay yields variable quality work for a number of reasons,
% but before we discuss the causes of this effect, we should discuss the

% Variance in the quali

The effect low wages have had on piece work and factory workers is well--known;
\citeauthor{gantt1913work} discuss this exact mechanism in his book on
\citetitle{gantt1913work}, pointing out that
``\dots~where there is no union,
the class wage is practically gauged by the wages the poor workman will accept,
and the good workman soon becomes discouraged and \textit{sets his pace by that of his less efficient neighbor},
with the result that the general tone of the shop is lowered'' (emphasis added)
\cite{gantt1913work}.

This research is similar to, but subtly different from, the notion of the ``market for `lemons'''
which \citeauthor{fort2011amazon} discuss;
specifically, \citeauthor{akerlof1970market}'s writing of a ``market for `lemons'''
describes a marketplace where the quality of the product or service is unknown to the buyer
\cite{fort2011amazon,akerlof1970market}.
The effect of this \textit{perceived} uncertainty is that
the \textit{actual} trustworthiness drops precipitously
as all of the consistent, reliable, high--quality workers capable of leaving these markets do so,
leaving only the ones who cannot or will not establish their trustworthiness.

\subsection{Relationships Between Workers and Managers}\label{sec:relationships}
Suffice it to say that poor pay and poor work are linked,
and that we should not be surprised to find this relationship play out online as strongly as it does offline.
But the poor treatment of workers by managers
--- both human and algorithmic ---
do more than affect the economic relationships between workers and employers.
Here, then, we turn to examine this facet of on--demand work
and how these dynamics strikingly replicate the relationships
researchers in labor advocacy encountered in the study of piecework and factory work.

This topic can be condensed into two major areas:
\begin{inlinelist}
\item external (scientific) management, and the evaluation of workers as functional modules; and
% \item the alienation of workers under this form of evaluation; and
\item the consequential resistance workers express due to their perceived alienation and distance from managing forces.
\end{inlinelist}

\subsubsection{External Management}
We discussed Fordism and Taylorism earlier in our discussions of
\nameref{sec:decomposition} and \nameref{sec:flexibility},
but here the core of these paradigmatic views
--- the scientific management of work ---
becomes relevant.
We use ``external'' here instead of ``scientific'', however,
to more broadly capture the disconnect between managers and workers.
By describing it as thus,
we can touch on the relationship that workers have with \textit{researchers}, as well,
even though that work is not strictly
--- or just not exclusively ---
of the same nature as the management and experience as when interacting with requesters.

First, intuitively, the variable--quality work we discussed previously has led to
a large and growing body of research attempting to evaluate workers' performance and error rates
across numerous dimensions;
for example, \citeauthor{measuringCrowdsourcingCheng} explore the error rates of workers by
operating on a sliding scale giving workers varying amounts of time to accomplish micro--tasks
\cite{measuringCrowdsourcingCheng}.
\citeauthor{storiesIraniSilberman} describe the treatment of workers
as sorts of ``human APIs'' that can, importantly, be rigorously evaluated
\cite{storiesIraniSilberman}.
\citeauthor{gevins2003neurophysiological} began to explore the neurophysiological effects of
cognitively demanding tasks on workers,
informing crowdsourcing research by suggesting the use of cognitive load assessments such as
NASA Task Load Index surveys to evaluate workers pre and post--tasks
\cite{embracingErrorKrishna,measuringCrowdsourcingCheng}.


External management comes in other forms than scientific, as previously mentioned.
Researchers in particular have noticed that their relationships with on--demand workers are,
at the least, complex.
\citeauthor{storiesIraniSilberman} point out that their relationships with Turkers are highly complex;
specifically, their interactions with field sites in which they work
as designers and mediators of change influence the relationships they have with Turkers
\cite{storiesIraniSilberman}.

The scientific management of pieceworkers has been well--studied under the umbrella of assembly line research,
and even physiological study of pieceworkers closely resembles the
research into cognitive loads and stress levels that we discussed among on--demand crowd workers
\cite{pieceworkBiologicalHarm,hu1961parallel}.
Even the complicated relationships between observers and workers themselves are not necessarily new;
\citeauthor{riisOtherSideLives}'s photodocumentary of pieceworkers has even been re--examined through an exercise asking crowd workers
to photograph themselves for similar purposes as \citeauthor{riisOtherSideLives}'s --- to document and humanize an otherwise abstracted, invisible workforce
\cite{facesOfMechanicalTurk,turkopticon,riisOtherSideLives}.

Similarly, \citeauthor{pollard1963factory}'s words on the punishment factory workers faced ---
for example, that ``unsatisfactory work was punished \dots~by fines or by dismissal'' ---
seems especially relevant given the fears we now know to be ubiquitous on platforms such as AMT, Uber, and other on--demand markets
\cite{pollard1963factory,uberAlgorithm,dynamo,turkopticon,takingAHITMcInnis}.

% \subsubsection{Alienated Workers}
% The dissatisfaction on crowd work systems is not as well--explored as their actual responses to that dissatisfaction
% (in various forms of resistance),
% but it's nevertheless worthwhile to point out some of the observations that have been made here,
% as external management, discussed earlier, and the discussion on worker resistance, to be discussed next,
% are bridged by this quality of on--demand labor markets.




% Unsurprisingly, workers have expressed a disassociation from the platforms on which they work and the work they do;
% T

% \itshape
% Marx's big entrance. Lily has lots of work pointing to this, and
% lots of that work points to yet more work gesturing in this direction.
% I want to bring a lot of that work
% that hasn't made it into the discussion yet
% into the conversation here.

% Note to self: examples of citations would help make it clearer for MSB which ones I'm overlooking,
% if nothing else

% \upshape


\subsubsection{Resistance}
It shouldn't surprise us, then, that workers have resisted the management imposed on them both by other people and their systems,
often without recourse or opportunity for feedback, let alone substantive input.
Indeed, \citeauthor{uberAlgorithm} discover of Uber drivers that 
many toggle their availability to avoid being dispatched to more distant locations,
resisting the intent of the designers of the systems and their ``algorithmic and data--driven management''
\cite{uberAlgorithm}.

Resistance has sometimes been more coordinated, as well;
we see this in \citeauthor{turkopticon}'s coverage on \textit{Turkopticon} as workers collectively accumulated information about requesters, and
in \citeauthor{dynamo}'s work on \textit{Dynamo}, which generated ``Guidelines for Academic Requesters'' written by crowd workers
\cite{turkopticon,dynamo}.

Resistance against managers in piecework and factory labor settings are deeply well--explored,
but perhaps the most relevant case study to draw on here is to be found in
\citeauthor{waldinger1996helots}'s case study of ``Justice for Janitors'',
where marginalized workers managed to raise awareness for their plight and secure support for badly needed reforms
\cite{waldinger1996helots}.
The achievements of labor advocacy groups such as labor unions as resistant,
even adversarial organizations counter--balancing the management
is somewhat well--understood
\cite{russell1982collective,craig1992behavior}.
We argue that these threads of resistance against management in various forms
are in fact one.


% \subsection{Resistance}
% So it's not surprising, then, that workers are frustrated:
% Turkopticon, Dynamo, and many other pieces of work point this out
% \cite{turkopticon,dynamo,uberAlgorithm}
% [\textit{also want to cite Brian's work from CHI this year}].
% In popular culture, reporters have inquired about
% what ``the future of labor unions'' will look like
% [\textit{Imagine I had cited an online article and
% it wasn't totally inappropriate for a conference}].

% \textit{The parallels here would be difficult to ignore;
% Lily and others have pointed this out,
% but it's worth thinking about the broader trend of
% resisting management,
% driven by routinization,
% enabled by discretization.
% Do that here.}


\section{The Bleak Future of Crowd Work}
We've traced a path from piecework itself through
the processes that describe the design and implementation of piece work and crowd work as part of the same thread;
in tracing this process, we touched on the relationships between decomposition,
work \& worker abstraction,
flexibility, and followed through both the general fallout of crowd work in the research community
as well as the fallout between workers and the managers and other external parties
--- including researchers.

Throughout these case studies, we have pointed out the parallels between
the contemporary research in on--demand labor and
the much larger body of research constituting our understanding of topics such as
piecework, factory work, and laborer relations.
If we agree that this framing is useful and informative, then
several topics emerge as relatively open questions in the study of crowd work and on--demand labor.
Two of the most pressing questions are
\begin{inlinelist}
\item the beginnings of factories, and 
\item the decline of relevance of worker advocacy organizations.
\end{inlinelist}
We will discuss those questions here.



\subsection{The beginnings of factories}\label{sec:Factorization}
We established earlier that abstracted work and low wages tend to result in variable outcomes,
which presents problems for employers.
% So work output is variable, and that's bad. What are we doing about it?
Historically, this is what led to factories; by employing a cohort of known workers,
we can be reasonably assured that the quality of the work will be better than random.
Furthermore, we can invest more resources in training workers and
get workers to do more complex work with more context.
% you would pay some experts who understood what they needed to do
% and they would form a cohort into which you invest more.

Some research already looks at research such as investing in workers, and
informally, we know that this happens among industry requesters
\cite{jonBrelig,shepherdingDow}.
AMT, meanwhile, offers requesters the ability to create tasks which are
not just hidden from unqualified workers by default, but completely.
Requesters have taken to using lists of worker IDs which reference
workers who have proven their reliability,
representing a sort of proto--organization of loosely connected workers.

This, then, suggests that the beginning of the regularization of workforces
--- a sort of coalescence of factories ---
is already happening.
If our framing of on--demand labor is accurately describing an underlying relationship with piecework,
then we should watch for the emergence and popularization of persistent teams of workers.
% While this field site will likely prove exceedingly difficult to 
% Social computing researchers should seek to understand this process more
% fully, as we a

\subsection{The decline of advocacy organizations}
The rise of labor unions in the \nth{20} century seems to have been precipitated by
severely unjust conditions imposed on workers in factories and elsewhere
\cite{ebbinghaus1999institutions}.
Incidents broadly describing this dynamic can be found in research on AMT
\cite{turkopticon,dynamo}.
If these are prototypical labor advocacy organizations of contemporary on--demand work,
the next question we should look to is if
--- and indeed \textit{how} ---
these institutions might face challenges in the future.

For insight on this, we return to \citeauthor{levi2009union}'s study of labor unions,
and identify that
``Scholars who evaluate union governance by procedural criteria generally find that oligarchy tends to arise and persist even when democratic procedures are in place''
\cite{levi2009union}.
% Indeed, \citeauthor{levi2009union} writes about the general perception that labor unions were either
% unable to satisfy their needs or otherwise more invested in the 
This perception already appears to be emerging in digitally mediated peer--governed organizations,
as \citeauthor{keegan2010egalitarians} and others have illustratively documented
\cite{beschastnikh2008wikipedian,keegan2010egalitarians}.
If these organizations and others are to avoid the same fate that labor unions faced,
they should take care to study this phenomenon and attempt to avoid it.

\section{Implications for Design}
If it's agreed that
the major topics we've discussed thus far are related and
--- at least to \textit{some} extent ---
precipitated in the fashion we argue,
then we have a rare opportunity as researchers,
and as agents of change in the communities we study,
to affect change on the dynamics of crowd and on--demand work
as they continue to develop.

Without claiming to have easy, cut--and--dry solutions to these problems,
we can nevertheless bring to attention a number of critical opportunities to
learn from historical parallels in piecework and factory labor,
and make informed decisions regarding whether
(or indeed how)
we may want to influence outcomes.
The challenges we bring to attention here are as follows:
\begin{inlinelist}
  \item codifying investment toward collective goods into the designs of systems;
  \item (re--)decentralizing the internet; and
  \item enabling reputation transferral.
\end{inlinelist}


\subsection{Codify the common good}
As \citeauthor{lessig2006code} points out in his book,
digital media give designers the opportunity to design and build into the systems
policies and practices to contribute to the collective benefit of the people therein
\cite{lessig2006code}.
Historically, the confluence of forces \citeauthor{lessig2006code} describes
would ultimately result in outcomes such as benefits for workers,
funds for sick leave and vacation, and other conveniences.
The transient nature of on--demand work would seem to problematize this arrangement,
but we can discuss and explore the viability of building into systems the mechanisms necessary
to save a portion of payment from every gig,
record taxable income, or
myriad other generally administrative tasks automatically.


\subsection{Decentralize the internet --- again}
Digitally mediated on--demand labor markets have historically been insular and incompatible with one another,
forcing workers either to choose one or juggle participation in these markets with great difficulty.
An ``API'' for on--demand labor markets could make it possible for any person
or organization to instantiate their own marketplace and inter--operate with.
This can be changed, and indeed must, if we are to realize the hopes of early researchers who advocated the
democratizing nature and power of the internet
\cite{barlow2009declaration,lanier2014owns}.

\subsection{Deal with reputation}
Reputation systems in on--demand labor markets are fundamentally broken.
To say nothing of the fact that information workers (such as those on AMT) can't transfer their reputations to qualitatively different forms of labor
like driving--for--hire (e.g. Uber), even within the same industry
it's currently not feasible for workers to transfer their reputations or other information from one place to another.
This affects more than the reputation and trustworthiness of workers;
accounting for things such as taxes, benefits, etc\dots is all but left to the individual workers, who struggle with myriad bureaucratic obstacles.
We can design systems that facilitate the aggregation and, more importantly, the transferral of reputation, income, and other features of work.



\section{Discussion}
We've discussed a number of aspects of on--demand work that
offer parallels with historical piecework.
Perhaps more importantly, we've hopefully demonstrated that the dynamics we observe in on--demand work
are interrelated and follow from one another just as necessarily as they did in
the development and maturation of piecework and factory work through the \nth{20} century.
This framing on on--demand work should, we hope, provide us with the necessary historical context
to make better--informed design decisions about how we want ``the future of crowd work'' to look.

\section{Conclusion}
\citeauthor{crowdworkFuture} discussed many of the challenges and problems in crowd work in \citeyear{crowdworkFuture},
but didn't necessarily situate the notion of crowd work in a broader context.
This paper attempts to fill that gap, and in doing so hopes
to give the research community theoretical grounding to work with and within on--demand labor more successfully.
But more than that, we hope to have addressed important questions to inform how we actually might make crowd work
a career in which we want our children to work.
