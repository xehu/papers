\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we considered three overarching questions in crowd work
--- \begin{inlinelist}
  \item ``\namerefl{sec:complexity}?'';
  \item ``\namerefl{sec:decomposition}?'';
        and
  \item ``\namerefl{sec:relationships}?''
\end{inlinelist} ---
by using the scholarship on piecework to inform our predictions and
to contextualize the answers that crowd work researchers have already uncovered.
We subsequently take this historical framing to ask broader questions of crowd work,
including among others what the future of crowd work holds for workers.
