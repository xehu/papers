\begin
{itemize}
\item
on--demand
labor
has
consumed
an
increasing
proportion
of
the
labor
market
in
the
past
ten
years
[\textit
{Pew
research
on
on--demand
labor}];
the
work
has
ranged
from
Turk
work
processes
\item
some
of
it
has
been
about
resisting
Uber
\&
other
gig
labor
platforms
\cite
{bernsteinSoylent,uberAlgorithm};
some
researchers
have
tackled
understanding
this
new
instantiation
of
work,
but
come
up
short
(\textit
{how}).
\par
\item
(what
binds
this
together)
\item
we
offer
a
framing
on
this
topic
that
situates
the
research
so
far
on
a
timeline
of
the
maturation
of
another
form
of
work
that
emerged
approximately
150
years
ago
---
that
is,
piecework
---
which
convincingly
suggests
that
on--demand
labor
in
the
form
of
Turking,
driving
for
Uber,
etc\dots
are
in
fact
little
more
than
piecework
re--surging
today.
\par
\item
this
paper
will
trace
the
body
of
research
describing
microwork
---
and
later
gig
work
---
and
place
it
in
the
context
of
historical
piecework
and
the
industrial
revolution
as
a
whole.
\item
informed
by
this
new
lens,
we'll
then
turn
our
attention
to
the
future
of
this
re--emergent
form
of
work,
and
suggest
ways
that
researchers
and
users
of
on--demand
labor
might
influence
the
outcomes
we
predict
in
this
paper.
