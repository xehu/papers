The Review


1AC: The Meta-Review

   The submission provides a novel historical lens through which to view
   contemporary human computation tasks. An enormous body of
   interdisciplinary literature is brought to bear to examine the
   antecedents of decomposition, distribution, and payment that predate
   prevailing crowdworker/gig economy models. The submission provides
   important historical contexts and cases to ground contemporary debates
   makes it of enormous interest and relevance for the CHI community. There
   is an unusually high degree of consensus among diverse reviewers that the
   paper is well-written, novel, and exhaustive. R5 notes some concerns
   about stripping away context in pursuit of conclusions given the
   substantial differences in social/economic/cultural context.

Your Assessment of this Paper's Contribution to HCI

   In this 9.5-page paper, the authors aim to understand crowd work through
   the historical lens of piecework, a trend of work decomposition,
   distribution, and payment. The authors are motivated to learn from
   history so as not to repeat. They conduct literature review of piecework
   to anticipate answers to a) limits of crowd work b) limits of work
   decomposition in crowdwork and c) worker’s relationships with each
   other and their crowd work.  The primary contribution of this work is a
   historical perspective on the most recent decade of crowdsourcing
   research.

The Review

   Crowdwork is of interest and valuable to a reasonably broad subset of the
   CHI community. The authors do a nice job presenting a detailed literature
   review of piecework and related constructs (Taylor’s Scientific
   Management) and explaining the new understandings gained in crowdwork.
   They also demonstrate the value of this new understanding to CHI. 

   As the authors note, previous researchers have made the connection
   between piecework and crowdwork but have not explored the relationship in
   as much depth.  One might argue that they have instead looked to more
   recent theories in industrial engineering (optimization) and management
   science (job enrichment; job design) which inevitably were informed by
   early work on piecework.  Regardless, I believe there is value in
   situating current theories of crowdwork in relation to historical
   theories when considering complexity limits of work, task decomposition,
   and worker relationships.  Too often, we fail to learn from the past.
   This paper offers an extensive reference list and introduction for those
   entering the field of study and learning from the past.

   One small suggestion for improvement would be to consider explaining why
   you chose not to address other components of crowdwork including
   incentives structures and professional advancement.

   In short, I believe this paper is worthy of publication at CHI.

Rebuttal response

    I have read the author's rebuttal and feel they have adequately
   addressed my concerns. I am confident that they will be able to make
   their suggested changes in the short time frame allowed. I am very much
   looking forward to seeing this paper presented at CHI and then
   subsequently assigning it to my students.

Your Assessment of this Paper's Contribution to HCI

   The contribution of this paper is to provide a comparative approach to
   thinking about the future of crowd work in the context of piecework
   history. It provides an account of the way human employment, has evolved
   and shifted over time.  

The Review

   Overall I quite enjoyed reading this paper. It is well written, and how
   we understand and study crowd work and other facets of ‘sharing
   economy’ concepts is topical. The use of the piecework lens has helped
   me personally to better understand the phenomenon, and provides a
   meaningful way to articulate how it evolves moving forward.

   The timely nature of the topic contributes to its significance, and there
   is significant literature supporting the positions presented. The work
   would appear original in its ideas (in the context of HCI research at
   least).

   The validity of this work can - and should - be challenged as part of an
   ongoing discussion about the role of HCI in the context of crowd work,
   and its place within society.

   I am satisfied with the writing and presentation approach - I found the
   document to be clear and well written.

   Changes I would suggest the authors consider:

   * Add something - perhaps as part of the review of piecework - about the
   quantity-quality dilemma/scale and how it relates to the complexity of
   work. It is unpacked more later as part of the problems, but I think it
   would be of benefit to have it clearer from the outset.
   * Some discussion that contrasts HCI researcher’s perspective studying
   the experiences of crowd work, with what it means, and whether it is
   ethical, to make use of crowd work in HCI research.
   * Further to the above - more discussion about forward looking strategies
   that the HCI community can and should investigate would be welcome.


   Other recent work worth investigating that is relevant to the discourse
   on crowdsourcing that mentions (in passing) a piecework comparison:
   Williamson, V. (2016). On the ethics of crowdsourced research. PS:
   Political Science & Politics, 49(01), 77-81.

Rebuttal response

   Happy with the authors response. Have adjusted my score up slightly, as I
   am more convinced the proposed changes/clarifications make for an
   important contribution.

Your Assessment of this Paper's Contribution to HCI

   The paper has a laudable goal of placing work on crowdsourcing into a
   historical perspective, comparing it to early 20th century piecework. It
   is not common for HCI scholarship to try to understand through historical
   comparison. The paper draws upon a large literature - only a small part
   of it historical.

The Review

   I think the paper is quite unusual in its goal of setting important
   contemporary HCI work in an historical context. Unfortunately, I think
   the paper does not draw very deep or insightful comparisons. The paper
   uses history to draw structural comparisons between then and now - much
   in the way that an economist or organizational scientist would apply
   history for their own purposes. One common shortcoming of history by
   organizational scientists or economists (but by no means all such
   scholarship, e.g. there is great use of history by the economist Nathan
   Rosenberg) is that it strips away all context and draws conclusions that
   are ahistorical. I think this is a problem with this paper. Another
   problem with this paper is that while it has a very long list of
   citations, there are only two or three, e.g. David Grier's book on human
   computers, that he really engages in the text. The author would have been
   better advised to take a small number of historical cases and compare
   them in greater depth to contemporary crowdsourcing. This would have
   given the author more opportunity to understand how the context in which
   the work was done mattered or did not matter - for there are very
   different conditions for carrying out and delivering work today compared
   to 100 years ago. Scientific management and production lines are
   mentioned in passing in the paper, but the leading historical literature
   on this subject, such as that by David Hounsell and Merrit Roe Smith, is
   not cited.

Rebuttal response

   I feel slightly better about the paper based upon the author comments in
   the rebuttal. I think the paper will be better for the changes they
   propose making. I do not wish to change my overall score.
