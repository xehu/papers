% \begin{abstract}
% The ``gig economy''
% --- where work is measured through discrete tasks rather than through interconnected (and often long--running) careers ---
% has become a site of significant frustration among workers who have come to rely on these systems and this form of work.
% This paper explores some of the sources of that stress,
% and attempts to relate this seemingly nascent work style to more familiar forms of labor
% --- namely, ``piece work'',
% a form of work which emerged at the dawn of the 20th century.
% While we find and identify parallels between ``gig work'' and the more theoretically familiar ``piece work'',
% we emphasize divergences which make the conflation of these ideas problematic.

% We further explore opportunities and tactics to empower workers,
% informed by ethnographic fieldwork including participant--observation,
% semi--structured interviews,
% and participatory design.
% Our observation and interviews lead us to conclude that the most intuitive mechanisms for empowering workers
% --- namely, labor unions advocating collectively and counter--balancing the manager's outsize leverage ---
% may both structurally and culturally fail to capture the needs of ``gig workers''.
% We argue that design interventions to empower ``gig workers'' must build on the theoretically familiar,
% much as ``gig work'' itself draws inspiration from ``piece work'',
% but that it is crucial that interventions are designed to support,
% rather than reject,
% the unique cultural and system qualities of gig workers.
